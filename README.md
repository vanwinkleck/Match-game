# Match-game

A simple NFL match game made in java. I made this in the spring of 2020 as a final project with my partner Mohammad Alabdalla for CSCI2300: Object Oriented Software Design taught by Kate Holdener at SLU. We received help from her throughout the process, and of course Mohammad helped as well. A short description of the requirements for the project can be found below. 


    The project must use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java SWING API.
    The project must allow the user to select from at least two options.
        If your project is a game, it may have several configuration options
        If your project is a game against the computer, the options may be the "difficulty level"
        For example, in the Black Jack application, we could have added an option to set the bet amount
    Some application state can be saved when the application exits and re-loaded when application starts up.
        For example, high scores can be saved and re-loaded
        Another example, for the Black Jack application, we could have saved and re-loaded the amount of money the player has remaining.
